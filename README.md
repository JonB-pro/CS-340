Client/Server Development

### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
Keeping code concise and reusing where possible cuts down on bulk, and using proper commenting helps with readability and adaptability for future updates. This module could be used in the future with other mongo databases with just a few changes.
    
### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
You have to take the request of the client, use your prior knowledge to develop a working prototype, ask for input on preference, and be able to properly search out knowledge on anything you are not sure of how to accomplish. This project was different in approach since it was the first that I created seperate files that worked with one another. The basic CRUD implementation and some of the libraries I didn't know of before, like Dash, will help in future database development.
    
### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
They create useable applications based on client requests, which gives the users easier ways to accomplish their tasks. For this project, it allows the company to search for specific animals in the Austin area quicker, and in a single repository, instead of having to scan through a large excel file or go to individual shelter sites.
